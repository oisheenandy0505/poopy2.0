        <p>
          I’m sorry. Truly. Not in a “please forget it” way - in a
          <span class="hl-pink">“I understand the impact, and I own my part”</span> way.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve had time to sit with what happened and what it says about me.
          The root wasn’t anger or manipulation or anything you did — it was
          <span class="hl-yellow">fear</span>.
          Fear that I’m not enough, fear of being vulnerable, fear of disappointing you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here’s what matters most: you didn’t deserve any confusion, mixed signals, or emotional turbulence.
          You deserve someone who communicates clearly, trusts your love, and respects your effort.
          <span class="hl-blue">That’s the standard.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m not going to make you carry my insecurity.
          I’m not going to turn love into a guessing game.
          I’m not going to need you to “prove” anything to calm me down.
          <span class="hl-green">That’s my job.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve started making changes :
          shifting my mindset to acknowledge feelings when they show up and being direct,
          and building a life where I feel grounded in myself - career, confidence, routine —
          so I don’t look to you to fix what I need to build internally.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I want you to know this clearly:
          <span class="hl-pink">I’m here to stay.</span>
          I’m here to grow up emotionally, not just say pretty words.
          I got really lucky with you — and I’m not letting my own stupidity get in the way of something good.
        </p>

        <p class="readme-end">
          You don’t have to monitor me.
          You don’t have to manage my growth.
          You don’t have to hold my hand through every feeling.
          What you <em>can</em> do is just be you —
          and I’ll meet you there with vulnerability, honesty, and love.
